# Crime and Weather Analysis in Colchester, UK

## Project Overview

This repository contains an analysis of the relationship between crime and weather patterns in Colchester, UK, for the year 2023. The analysis aims to uncover any potential correlations between weather conditions (such as temperature, precipitation, and visibility) and crime rates, offering insights that could be valuable for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and the local community.

## Key Questions Addressed

1. **Weather Conditions and Crime Rates**: Do specific weather conditions, such as temperature, precipitation, or visibility, coincide with increased crime activity in Colchester?
2. **Crime Types and Weather Fluctuations**: Are certain crime types more susceptible to weather fluctuations than others?
3. **Conviction Rate**: Is the conviction rate sufficient for the public to feel safe?

## Findings

- Violent crimes were the most prevalent, followed by thefts.
- Crime rates were higher in the eastern and northern parts of Colchester.
- A weak positive correlation was observed between temperature and violent crimes, while property damage and theft showed a negative correlation.
- Lower visibility conditions coincided with higher crime rates.
- Moderate precipitation days correlated with fewer property damage incidents, while heavy precipitation days correlated with increased thefts.
- The low case resolution rate suggests a need for improving police effectiveness in Colchester.
